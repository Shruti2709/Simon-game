# Simon-game
Simon Game is a classic memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player must repeat an ever-increasing sequence of colors in the correct order. With each level, the pattern gets longer, testing memory and attention. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
